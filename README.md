# benzdetails-webscraping
Popular make vehicles web scraping project:-
Created a web scraping code by using BeautifulSoup library from python for benz vehicle and collected details such as model, model year, export status, mileage, fuel type etc.
It would be similar for other vehilces. Only we need to change the vehicles link to extract its respective vehilces above details
I have cleaned the data for analysis and in more focus I have done price analysis.
I have created Dashboard by tableau software and see below link for direct access to the dashboards
